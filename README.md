# Radhe Sweet
## Project Overview
The Sweet Shop Management System (Admin Panel) is a full-stack web application designed specifically for sweet shop administrators to efficiently manage day-to-day business operations from a centralized dashboard. This project provides an intuitive, responsive interface that enables the admin to perform critical tasks such as employee management, product inventory tracking, and performance analytics.

At the heart of the application is a comprehensive admin dashboard, which aggregates and displays data from all functional modules such as products, employees, stock levels, notifications, and analytics — giving the shop owner a complete overview at a glance.

The Employee Management module allows the admin to add, update, or delete employee records seamlessly. In the Product Management section, admins can manage the sweet items being sold by adding new products, updating existing ones, or removing them from the inventory. The Stock Management system enables admins to monitor product quantities and restock items when inventory falls below a certain threshold. To make this process more efficient, a notification system alerts the admin in real time when a product's stock is running low, a restock action has been completed, or a new employee is added — with timestamps included for reference.

Finally, the Analytics page visualizes key metrics such as total income, product sales, and purchase trends. This data-driven insight helps shop owners make informed decisions, identify best-selling items, and track growth over time.

The backend is built using FastAPI for robust and high-speed API operations, while the frontend leverages v0.dev-generated components in React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and deployed using Vercel for global accessibility.

## My AI Usage

### Tools Used:
**v0.dev** – An AI-powered UI generation tool by Vercel
**ChatGPT** – AI assistant by OpenAI

### How I Used Them:
I used **v0.dev** to create beautiful and functional UI components for the React frontend by simply describing the layout I needed. This saved significant development time and ensured a polished design.
I used **ChatGPT** to guide backend development, explain FastAPI configurations, structure API endpoints, and draft the README documentation.


### Reflection on AI Usage

Using AI tools made the entire development process faster and more efficient. Instead of spending hours writing boilerplate frontend code, I could focus on logic and integration while **v0.dev** handled the UI scaffolding. **ChatGPT** helped clarify doubts during backend development and provided suggestions on how to organize the project better. Overall, AI acted as a coding companion, accelerating learning and improving productivity without compromising quality.
